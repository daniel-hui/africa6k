#8) LD decay curves (inset with long range vs ROH)
        #nuance:
                #only use pops N >= 50 (b/c the LD is noisy with lower N)
                        #use R2 adjusted for sample size
                #Use same exact SNPs in every population (SNPs must be >MAF in all populations (can't merge then filter at the end))
                        #especially between 1KG, coverage difference or something I think
